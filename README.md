# Open Data Enrichment / Integration Service API

This experimental API assembles relevant public data about a set of
companies, organizations or people. Such data could includes any
relevant facts, from company records to social network profiles.

Data is collected from remote services upon request: when a user
requests more information about an entity (or a set of entities),
relevant spiders are activated and tasked to retrieve information about
similar entities from on-line databases.

Finally, the core engine performs an assessment of whether these
results are matches for the initial request and return fitting candidates
for integration to the user.


## Domain Model

As this is an exercise in data integration, it makes sense to adopt a
Linked Data-inspired data model. In such a model, there is no
un-ambiguous set of attributes that a person or company has. Instead,
all information is given in the form of statements, which assign a 
property value to an entity. Each statement is part of a context, which
states the source of the information and how trusted it is.

Assessing whether a given entity in the context A is the same as another
entity in context B then becomes an explicit mapping task which may 
require user input.


## Spider API

Spiders must have an easy-to-use API which they can use to receive
search requests from the system core and generate potential matches.


## Web API

Submitting a crawl request:

```
POST /api/1.0/crawl
```

This expects a JSON-formatted search query, and will return a simple crawl ID reference which the client can check as spider information is retrieved. This is an example request:

```json
{
    "queries": [
        {
            "type": "Company",
            "label": "Chevron Inc."
        },
        {
            "type": "Person",
            "label": "William Gates"
        }
    ]
}
```

A response could look like this:

```json
{
    "status": "pending",
    "crawl_id": "5b5b9278-0bf7-4cb6-9e7f-289bb9a893e1",
    "crawl_uri": "http://uf6.service.org/api/1/crawls/5b5b9278-0bf7-4cb6-9e7f-289bb9a893e1"
}
```

## Origins

The design of this API is inspired by discussions on the
[uf6 (data enrichment)](http://github.com/uf6) group. It can also be
seen as a scoping experiment for the upcoming SuperTraMp project.
