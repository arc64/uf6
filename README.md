# Open Data Enrichment / Integration Service API

This experimental API assembles relevant public data about a set of
companies, organizations or people. Such data could includes any
relevant facts, from company records to social network profiles.


## Origins

The design of this API is inspired by discussions on the
[uf6 (data enrichment)](http://github.com/uf6) group. It can also be
seen as a scoping experiment for the upcoming SuperTraMp project.
